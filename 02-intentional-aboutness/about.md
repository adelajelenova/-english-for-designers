As a graphic designer, I aim to design in a clear, concise, and modern way.

Born and living in Prague. I love playing field hockey, 16 years and counting. I like to bake, but I don't eat sweets. Besides graphic design, I also work as a stuntwoman. I think I'm quite funny, I can make fun of myself. And I'm surprisingly clever, but only in the car (my secret gift :D)*. Jokes aside, I'm also very responsible.

*Story time: When I was on a trip with my classmates, we played word games in the car. And I always said the word and no one knew what it meant. Nobody expected that. Since then, we're kidding that I'm clever only in the car.
