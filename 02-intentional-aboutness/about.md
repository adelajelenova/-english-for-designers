As a graphic designer, I try to do my works concisely, clearly, but also in a modern way.

I was born in Prague. I'm playing field hockey for 16 years. I like to bake, but I don't eat sweet foods. Besides graphic design, I also work as a stuntwoman. I think I'm quite funny. I can make fun of myself. I am abnormally smart only in the car (my secret gift :D). Also I think I'm responsible.
