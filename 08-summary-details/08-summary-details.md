## Abstract
This bachelor thesis deals with the creation of a new visual style for the already functioning field hockey sport. At first, describes the visual and marketing state of the sport in the Czech Republic. Then compares the visual and promotional functioning of other countries of field hockey in the country and also analyses other sports in the Czech Republic. In practical terms, there's a presentation of my suggestions for a better running of the sport. The target is to make a new visual style and marketing strategies to better promote and attract sponsors and money. 

Key words: field hockey, sport, marketing strategy, visual style, identity, graphic design, media design

## Field hockey
Field hockey is an olympic sport for women and men. It is known around the world as hockey. In the Czech Republic, when somebody says hockey, everyone imagines ice hockey. I would like to help field hockey to become visible. Field hockey has an old logo that is not complex with the whole visual. That's why I decided to redo it.
