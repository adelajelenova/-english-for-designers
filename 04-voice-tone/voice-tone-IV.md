# Chapter IV

Copying. For some, copying is unacceptable. For me, copying is something I'm learning. Everyone copies, it's part of our lives. Even if someone does not admit it, he has certainly done it before. 

For example, painters. They copy every time they paint their work. 
From an early age, teachers teach us, through copying. When a teacher draws something and wants us to draw it the same way, it's also a form of copying. 
Sometimes people don't want to admit that they're copying, so they call it inspired.
